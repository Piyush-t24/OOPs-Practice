/*Q.2 Write a C++ language program to accept a float number through the keyboard. Create a
class that contains two private data members: a and b. Furthermore, the class contains a public
member function that calculates the square of the number and then separates the float number
into integer and fractional parts and assigns the value to the private members a and b
respectively. Finally, calculate the square of an integer and fractional part and add them to
another variable c.*/
